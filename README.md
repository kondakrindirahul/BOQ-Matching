# BOQ-Matching
* Created a python script to match the Master BOQs' (Bill of Quantities) with the Project BOQs'. 
* The matching was implemented using the idea of TF-iDF. 
* SpaCy, an industrial strength NLP library has  also been utilized for this task.
* Unsupervised learning algorithm LDA (Latent Dirchlet Allocation) was also implemented on the Master BOQ Dataset to find interesting patterns to aid in the matching process.
* The Jupyter Notebooks walk through the implementation of the project.
